        ## Explanation:
            The function performs an "absolute round" operation on the Vector2D other.

            The "absolute round" operation involves taking the absolute values of both the x and y components of the Vector2D other,

            The default value of n is 1, which means the "absolute rounded" vector will have the same magnitude as the original vector.

            If the provided numeric value (n) is 0, the function returns a Vector2D other with zeros for both components.

            If the provided numeric value (n) is negative, the resulting "absolute rounded" vector will point in the opposite direction
            as the original vector but will have the same magnitude.

            Note: The "absolute round" operation does not perform standard mathematical rounding; instead, it ensures the resulting

            normal (float, int, Vector2D, V2, list, tuple): The normal vector representing the surface of reflection.

        ## Returns:
            Vector2D or V2: The reflected vector.

        ## Example:

        ## Explanation:
            This method calculates the reflection of the current vector over the given normal vector.
            The normal vector represents the surface of reflection, and it should be normalized (unit vector).

            The method first normalizes the 'normal' vector using the '__normalize__' method of the vector.
            Next, it calculates the projection of the current vector onto the 'normal' vector using the 'projection' method.
            The reflected vector is obtained by subtracting twice the projection from the current vector.

            The resulting reflected vector is returned.

            Example usage is shown in the "Example" section above.

        ## Explanation:
            This method converts Cartesian coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, theta).
            'r' is the radial distance (magnitude) from the origin to the point, and 'theta' is the angle
            (in radians) measured from the positive x-axis to the point.

            The method calculates the radial distance 'r' using the 'magnitude' method of the vector.
            The angle 'theta' is calculated using the arctan2 function, which takes the y and x components of the vector.

            The resulting 'r' and 'theta' are returned as a tuple.

        ## Explanation:
            This method performs linear interpolation between the current vector and the 'other' vector.
            The 't' parameter represents the interpolation parameter, which controls how much the interpolation
            leans towards the 'other' vector. When 't' is 0, the result will be equal to the current vector (self).
            When 't' is 1, the result will be equal to the 'other' vector. For intermediate values of 't', the
            result will be a linear combination of the two vectors, smoothly transitioning between them.

            If 'other' is not a Vector2D instance, it will be converted to one using the '__normalize__' method.
            If 't' is not within the range [0, 1], a ValueError is raised.

def angular_interpolation(starting_angle:int|float, final_angle:int|float, step:int|float=.1) -> float:
    """
    # Perform angular interpolation between two angles using the shortest distance.

    ## Parameters:
        starting_angle (int or float): The initial angle in radians.
        final_angle (int or float): The target angle in radians to interpolate towards.
        step (int or float, optional): The step size for interpolation in radians. Default is 0.1.

    ## Returns:
        float: The interpolated angle as a result of angular interpolation.

    ## Example:

        print(f"Interpolated angle: {interpolated_angle}")

        This will print the interpolated angle using angular interpolation.

    ## Explanation:
        The function calculates three distances between the `starting_angle` and the
        `final_angle`. These distances represent possible angular interpolations:
            1. The direct interpolation from `starting_angle` to `final_angle`.
            2. The interpolation by taking a full circle (2 * pi) and then proceeding from
               `starting_angle` to `final_angle`.
            3. The interpolation by taking a full circle (2 * pi) in the opposite direction
               and then proceeding from `starting_angle` to `final_angle`.

        The function then chooses the shortest distance from the three options and returns
        the interpolated angle obtained by multiplying the shortest distance by the `step`
        value.

        The `step` parameter controls the granularity of interpolation. Smaller `step` values
        provide more fine-grained interpolation but may require more iterations.

def color_distance(starting_c:list|tuple, final_c:list|tuple, sqrd:bool=True) -> float:

    # Calculate the distance between two colors in RGB space.

    ## Parameters:
        starting_c (list or tuple): The RGB values of the starting color.
        final_c (list or tuple): The RGB values of the final color.
        sqrd (bool, optional): If True, return the squared distance. If False, return
                               the actual distance. Default is True.

    ## Returns:
        float: The squared distance between the two colors if `sqrd` is True, otherwise
               the actual distance.

    ## Example:
        starting_c = [255, 0, 0]

        final_c = [0, 255, 0]

        squared_distance = color_distance(starting_c, final_c)

        distance = color_distance(starting_c, final_c, sqrd=False)

        print(f"Actual Distance: {distance}")

        This will calculate the squared and actual distances between the colors.

    ## Explanation:
        The function first calculates the squared distance between the two colors in RGB
        space. It does this by computing the sum of the squared differences of the RGB
        components for each color. The squared distance is obtained by taking the square
        root of this sum.

        The `sqrd` parameter allows the user to choose between returning the squared
        distance or the actual distance. If `sqrd` is True, the function returns the
        squared distance, and if `sqrd` is False, it returns the actual distance.

        print(average_pos)

        This will print the average position of the three Vector2D others.

    ## Explanation:
        The function takes a variable number of Vector2D others as input, representing positions.
        It calculates the sum of all the Vector2D others using the `sum` function and then divides
        it by the total number of others (length of `others`) to find the average position.

    ## Explanation:
        The function finds the intersection points (if any) between the given ray (or line segment) and the provided list
        of line segments. The intersection points are returned in a list.

        If return_inter_lines is True, the function returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the intersection point

        is False, the function returns only a list of intersection points (Vector2D) without the corresponding line segments.

        If sort is True, the intersection points are sorted by their distance from the ray's start point. If sort is False,
        the intersection points are returned in the order they were found.

        If return_empty is True, the function includes None for line segments with no intersection. If return_empty is False,
