# Usage

# 1. `__init__.py__`

##### The `__init__.py` module is the entry point of the e2D library. It provides the following classes:

#### Key Features:
- Easy Initialization: The V2 class can be easily initialized by providing the x and y components of the vector.
- Clean Representation: The V2 class provides a clean and readable representation of 2D vectors, making it easy to work with and understand.
- Lightweight: The V2 class is a lightweight implementation, making it suitable for performance-critical applications.
    
### Example 1: Basic Vector Operations

```python
from e2D import V2

# Create some 2D vectors
vector1 = V2(3.0, 4.0)
vector2 = V2(-1.0, 2.5)

# Perform vector addition
result_add = vector1 + vector2
print("Vector Addition:", result_add)  # Output: Vector Addition: V2(2.0, 6.5)

# Perform vector subtraction
result_sub = vector1 - vector2
print("Vector Subtraction:", result_sub)  # Output: Vector Subtraction: V2(4.0, 1.5)

# Perform vector scaling
scalar = 2.5
scaled_vector = vector1 * scalar
print("Vector Scaling:", scaled_vector)  # Output: Vector Scaling: V2(7.5, 10.0)

# Calculate the dot product of two vectors
dot_product = vector1.dot(vector2)
print("Dot Product:", dot_product)  # Output: Dot Product: 0.5

# Calculate the magnitude (length) of a vector
magnitude = vector1.magnitude()
print("Magnitude:", magnitude)  # Output: Magnitude: 5.0

# Normalize a vector (convert to unit vector)
normalized_vector = vector1.normalize()
print("Normalized Vector:", normalized_vector)  # Output: Normalized Vector: V2(0.6, 0.8)

# Calculate the distance between two points represented by vectors
distance = vector1.distance_to(vector2)
print("Distance between vectors:", distance)  # Output: Distance between vectors: 6.324555320336759
```

### Example 2: Using Vectors in a Simple Physics Simulation

```python
from e2D import V2

# Define the position and velocity of an object
position = V2(0.0, 0.0)
velocity = V2(5.0, 2.0)

# Update the position based on velocity and time
time_step = 0.1
position += velocity * time_step

print("New Position:", position)  # Output: New Position: V2(0.5, 0.2)
```

### Example 3: Calculating Forces in a 2D Physics Engine

```python
from e2D import V2

# Define a force acting on an object
force = V2(10.0, -5.0)

# Define the mass of the object
mass = 2.0

# Calculate the acceleration of the object using Newton's second law (F = ma)
acceleration = force / mass

print("Acceleration:", acceleration)  # Output: Acceleration: V2(5.0, -2.5)
```

### Example 4: Interpolating Between Two Points

```python
from e2D import V2

# Define two points A and B
point_a = V2(0.0, 0.0)
point_b = V2(10.0, 5.0)

# Interpolate between the two points at t = 0.3
t = 0.3
interpolated_point = V2.lerp(point_a, point_b, t)

print("Interpolated Point:", interpolated_point)  # Output: Interpolated Point: V2(3.0, 1.5)
```

### Example 5: Using Vectors in a Game Character

```python
from e2D import V2

class Character:
    def __init__(self, position):
        self.position = position
        self.velocity = V2(0.0, 0.0)

    def update(self, time_step):
        # Update the position based on velocity and time
        self.position += self.velocity * time_step

    def apply_force(self, force):
        # Calculate the acceleration and update velocity based on the applied force
        mass = 1.0  # Assume mass is 1 for simplicity
        acceleration = force / mass
        self.velocity += acceleration

# Create a character at position (0, 0)
character = Character(V2(0.0, 0.0))

# Apply a force to the character
force = V2(5.0, 2.0)
character.apply_force(force)

# Update the character's position after 0.1 seconds
time_step = 0.1
character.update(time_step)

print("Character Position:", character.position)  # Output: Character Position: V2(0.5, 0.2)
```

> These examples demonstrate various use cases of the `V2` or `Vector2D` class, including basic vector operations, physics simulations, interpolation, and game character movement. The `V2` class is versatile and can be used in a wide range of 2D applications and simulations.

##
# 2. `envs.py`

The `envs.py` module provides the `RootEnv` class, which acts as the root environment for a Pygame-based application.

```python
from e2D.envs import *

class Game:
    def __init__(self):
        self.position = V2(100, 100)
        self.velocity = V2(5, 2)

    def update(self):
        self.position = (self.position[0] + self.velocity[0], self.position[1] + self.velocity[1])

    def draw(self):
        rootEnv.print("Game Position: {}".format(self.position), rootEnv.screen_size * .5, center_y=True, center_x=True)

# Create a RootEnv with a screen size of 800x600 and target FPS of 60
rootEnv = RootEnv(screen_size=V2(800, 600), target_fps=60)

# Initialize the game with the Game class
game = Game()
rootEnv.init(game)

# Game loop
while not rootEnv.quit:
    rootEnv.frame()
```
##
# 2. `utils.py`
The `utils.py` module provides various utility classes and functions for input handling and more.
```python
from e2D.envs import *
# e2D.utils is already imported

class Game:
    def __init__(self):
        self.position = V2(100, 100)

    def update(self):
        # Move the position based on arrow key presses
        keyboard = rootEnv.keyboard
        if keyboard.get_key(pg.K_UP, mode=KEY_MODE_PRESSED):
            self.position = (self.position[0], self.position[1] - 5)
        if keyboard.get_key(pg.K_DOWN, mode=KEY_MODE_PRESSED):
            self.position = (self.position[0], self.position[1] + 5)
        if keyboard.get_key(pg.K_LEFT, mode=KEY_MODE_PRESSED):
            self.position = (self.position[0] - 5, self.position[1])
        if keyboard.get_key(pg.K_RIGHT, mode=KEY_MODE_PRESSED):
            self.position = (self.position[0] + 5, self.position[1])

    def draw(self):
        # Draw a circle at the mouse position when the left mouse button is pressed
        mouse = rootEnv.mouse
        if mouse.just_pressed[0]:
            pg.draw.circle(rootEnv.screen, (255,127,0), rootEnv.mouse.position(), 10)
        rootEnv.print("Game Position: {}".format(self.position), V2(10, 10))

# Create a RootEnv with a screen size of 800x600 and target FPS of 60
rootEnv = RootEnv(screen_size=V2(800, 600), target_fps=60)

# Initialize the game with the Game class
game = Game()
rootEnv.init(game)

# Game loop
while not rootEnv.quit:
    rootEnv.frame()
```
